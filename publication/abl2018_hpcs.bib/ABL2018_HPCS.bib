 abstract = {OCaml is a multi-paradigm (functional, imperative,  
object-oriented) high level sequential  
language. Types are statically inferred by the  
compiler and the type system is expressive and  
strong.  These features make OCaml a very productive  
language for developing efficient and safe programs.  
In this tutorial we present three frameworks for  
using OCaml to program scalable parallel  
architectures: BSML, Multi-ML and Spoc.},
