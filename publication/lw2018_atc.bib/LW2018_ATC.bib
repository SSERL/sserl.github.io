 abstract = {Frequent itemset mining is one pillar of machine  
learning and is very important for many data mining  
applications. There are many different algorithms  
for frequent itemset mining, but to our knowledge no  
implementation has been proven correct using  
computer aided verification. Hu et al. derived on  
paper an efficient algorithm for this problem,  
starting from an inefficient functional program and  
by using program calculation derived an efficient  
version. Based on their work, we propose a formally  
verified functional implementation for frequent  
itemset mining developed with the Coq proof  
assistant. All the proposed programs are evaluated  
on classical datasets and are compared to a non  
verified Java implementation of the Apriori  
algorithm.  },
