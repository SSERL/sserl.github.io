 abstract = {This paper presents an extension of a library for 
the Coq interactive theorem prover that enables the 
development of correct functional parallel programs 
based on sequential program transformation and 
automatic parallelization using an algorithmic 
skeleton named accumulate.  Such an algorithmic 
skeleton is a pattern of a parallel algorithm that 
is provided as a high-order function implemented in 
parallel. The use of this framework is illustrated 
with the bracket matching problem, including 
experiments on a parallel machine.},
