 abstract = {Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP) is a bridging model 
between abstract execution and concrete parallel 
architecture. In order to model BSP program 
executions Hains adapted the finite automata theory 
to the BSP paradigm by introducing BSP automata 
theory.  Benefit provided by BSP automata is 
twofold: modeling BSP program control and 
parallelizing finite state automata.  The lack of 
generation algorithm of BSP automata and the 
illusory lack of application of this theory has been 
preventing this theory from being used.  We propose 
in this paper an algorithm that generates a BSP 
automaton recognizing a defined BSP language.  In 
order to demonstrate the usefulness of BSP automata 
and help to design its use, two applications of the 
BSP automata theory are provided. The parallel 
recognition of an expression and debugging of a BSP 
program.},
