 abstract = {Frama-C is a software analysis framework that 
provides a common infrastructure and a common 
behavioral specification language to plugins that 
implement various static and dynamic analyses of C 
programs. Most plugins do not support 
concurrency. We have proposed conc2seq, a Frama-C 
plugin based on program transformation, capable to 
leverage the existing huge code base of plugins and 
to handle concurrent C programs.  In this paper we 
formalize and sketch the proof of correctness of the 
program transformation principle behind conc2seq, 
and present an effort towards the full mechanization 
of both the for- malization and proofs with the 
proof assistant Coq.},
