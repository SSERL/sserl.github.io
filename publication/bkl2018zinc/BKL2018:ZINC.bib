 abstract = {It is commonly said the "S" in Internet of Things
(IoT) stands for "Security": when it is not absent,
it is at least unnoticeable. However, security in
IoT becomes an important concern since in both the
industry and everyday life, it is gaining wider and
wider adoption. Thus, IoT is now targeting more
critical domains, and making domains that were not
critical, until now, collect and transmit a lot of
personal data.  For years, this kind of challenges
have been successfully addressed in highly critical
domains using formal methods. Now, formal methods
can help to bring security in the IoT field. Frama-C
is a source code analysis platform used to conduct
verification of industrial-size programs written in
ISO C99. It provides a collection of plug-ins that
perform static and dynamic analysis for safety and
security critical software. These plug-ins can
collaborate to the verification task thanks to their
integration on top of a shared kernel and their
compliance to ACSL, a specification language for C.
Participants will learn how to use different Frama-C
analyzers and how to combine their results. During
the tutorial, several examples and use-cases will
give them a clear practical vision of possible
usages of the underlying static and dynamic analyses
in their everyday work. The presented code fragments
are part of Contiki, a realworld lightweight
operating system for the IoT. Each part consists of
a presentation using slides and live demonstration,
and a session of exercises. The attendees will be
provided a virtual machine image for VirtualBox
containing all the tools ready to use, to work on
the exercises. We will also provide additional
exercises and we will be available during the
conference (and after) to help the attendees who may
want to go beyond the tutorial material.  },
