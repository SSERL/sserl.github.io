 abstract = { The SyDPaCC system is a set of libraries for the pr 
oof assistant Coq that allows to write naive (i.e. 
inef fi cient) functional programs then to transform 
them into ef fi cient versions that could be 
automatically parallelized within the framework 
before being extracted from Coq to code in the 
functional language OCaml plus calls to the parallel 
functional programming library Bulk Synchronous 
Parallel ML.  These goals of the tutorial are to 
provide an introduction to the development of 
correct-by-construction parallel programs, and to 
able the attendees to develop functio nal parallel 
programs using the SYDPACC system and the Coq proof 
assistant.  },
