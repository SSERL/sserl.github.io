 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications are becoming  
increasingly critical and require rigorous formal  
verification.  In this paper we target Contiki, a  
widely used open-source OS for IoT, and present a  
verification case study of one of its most critical  
modules: that of linked lists.  Its API and list  
representation differ from the classical linked list  
implementations, and are particularly challenging  
for deductive verification.  The proposed  
verification technique relies on a parallel view of  
a list through a companion ghost array.  This  
approach makes it possible to perform most proofs  
automatically using the Frama-C/WP tool, only a  
small number of auxiliary lemmas being proved  
interactively in the Coq proof assistant.  We  
present an elegant segment-based reasoning over the  
companion array developed for the proof.  Finally,  
we validate the proposed specification by proving a  
few functions manipulating lists.},
