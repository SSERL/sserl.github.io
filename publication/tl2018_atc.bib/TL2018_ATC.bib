 abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of  
a sequential simulator for the parallel functional  
language BSML based on the parallel computation  
model Bulk Synchronous Parallelism (BSP). This  
simulator is implemented in sequential, runs in any  
browser, and provides a graphical representation of  
the parallel executions.  Due to the pure functional  
nature of BSML, the results obtained by this  
simulator are the same than the results that could  
be obtained by executing the program in parallel},
