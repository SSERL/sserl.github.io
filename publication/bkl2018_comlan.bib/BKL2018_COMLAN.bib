 abstract = {With the wide expansion of multiprocessor  
architectures, the analysis and reasoning for  
programs under weak memory models has become an  
important concern. This work presents MMFilter, an  
original constraint solver for generating program  
behaviors respecting a particular memory model. It  
is implemented in Prolog using CHR (Constraint  
Handling Rules). The CHR formalism provides a  
convenient generic solution for specifying memory  
models. It benefits from the existing optimized  
implementations of CHR and can be easily extended to  
new models. We present MMFilter design, illustrate  
the encoding of memory model constraints in CHR and  
discuss the benefits and limitations of the proposed  
technique.},
