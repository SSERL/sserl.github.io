 abstract = { Frama-C is a framework that provides a common 
infrastructure and a common behavioral specification 
language to plugins that implement various static 
and dynamic analyses of C programs. Most plugin do 
not support concurrency. We have proposed 
\textscconc2seq a plugin that handles concurrent C 
programs, based on program transformation to 
leverage the existing huge code base of plugins.  In 
this paper we formalize and sketch the correctness 
of the program transformation principle behind 
\textscconc2seq, and present an effort towards the 
full mechanization of both the formalization and 
proofs with the proof assistant Coq },
