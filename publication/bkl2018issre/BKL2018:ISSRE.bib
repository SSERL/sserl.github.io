 abstract = {Abstract Among distributed systems, connected
devices and services, also referred to as the
Internet of Things (IoT), have proliferated very
quickly in the past years. There are now billions of
interconnected devices, and this number is
growing. It is anticipated that by 2021, about 46
billions of devices will be in use. Some of these
devices are in service in safety and security
critical domains, and even in domains that are not
necessarily critical, privacy issues may arise with
devices collecting and transmitting a lot of
personal information. Formal methods have been used
successfully for years in highly critical domains,
now they can help to bring security into the IoT
field. In practice it is common to rely on a
combination of formal methods to achieve an
appropriate degree of guarantee: static analyses to
guarantee the absence of runtime errors, deductive
verification of functional correctness, dynamic
verification for parts that cannot be proved using
deductive verification. This tutorial is focused on
Frama-C, which is a source code analysis platform
that aims at conducting verification of
industrial-size programs written in ISO C99 source
code. Frama-C fully supports the combination of
formal methods approach, by providing to its users
with a collection of plug-ins that perform static
and dynamic analysis for safety and security
critical software. Moreover collaborative
verification across cooperating plugins is enabled
by their integration on top of a shared kernel, and
their compliance to a common specification language
ACSL. Recently Frama-C has been applied to the
verification of software in the context of the
Internet of Things.},
