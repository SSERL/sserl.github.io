 abstract = {Cloud Computing has known in the past few years a  
fast development, leading to a spike in the number  
of companies competing on providing the best Cloud  
services. This makes it harder for potential Cloud  
customers to chose the adequate provider. Despite  
its wide adoption, many are still hesitant due to  
the security issues Cloud Computing poses. In this  
paper, we propose a brokerage solution that  
formalizes security properties under the form of  
inter-VM relations, and gives the possibility of  
setting these security requirements to its customers  
from the first steps. This solution uses formal  
methods and the finite model finder KodKod to verify  
the consistency of the customer's requirements, and  
to find a placement for his deployment model.},
