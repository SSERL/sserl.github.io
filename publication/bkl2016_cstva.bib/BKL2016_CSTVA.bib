 abstract = {With the wide expansion of multiprocessor 
architectures, the analysis and reasoning for 
programs under weak memory models has become an 
important concern.  This work presents an original 
constraint solver for detecting program behaviors 
respecting a particular memory model.  It is 
implemented in Prolog using CHR (Constraint Handling 
Rules).  The CHR formalism provides a convenient 
generic solution for specifying memory models, that 
benefits from the existing optimized implementations 
of CHR and can be easily extended to new models.  We 
briefly present the solver design, illustrate the 
encoding of memory model constraints in CHR and 
discuss the benefits and limitations of the 
proposal.  },
