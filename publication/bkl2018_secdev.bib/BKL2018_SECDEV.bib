 abstract = { Among distributed systems, connected devices and  
services, also referred to as the Internet of Things  
(IoT), have proliferated very quickly in the past  
years. There are now billions of interconnected  
devices, and this number is growing. It is  
anticipated that by 2021, about 46 billions of  
devices will be in use.  Some of these devices are  
in service in security critical domains, and even in  
domains that are not necessarily critical, privacy  
issues may arise with devices collecting and  
transmitting a lot of personal information. Moreover  
insufficiently secured devices may be used for  
example for massive distributed denial of service  
attacks.  This raises important security  
challenges. Formal methods have been used  
successfully for years in highly critical domains,  
now they can help to bring security into the IoT  
field.  While the correctness of an implementation  
with respect to a formal functional specification  
provides the strongest form of guarantee, it can be  
very costly to achieve. In practice it is therefore  
more common to rely on a combination of formal  
methods to achieve an appropriate degree of  
guarantee: static analyses to guarantee the absence  
of runtime errors, deductive verification of  
functional correctness, dynamic verification for  
parts that cannot be proved using deductive  
verification.  Frama-C is a source code analysis  
platform that aims at conducting verification of  
industrial-size programs written in ISO C99 source  
code. Frama-C fully supports the combination of  
formal methods approach, by providing to its users  
with a collection of plug-ins that perform static  
and dynamic analysis for safety and security  
critical software. Moreover collaborative  
verification across cooperating plug-ins is enabled  
by their integration on top of a shared kernel, and  
their compliance to a common specification language:  
ACSL~.  Recently Frama-C has been applied to the  
verification of software in the context of the  
Internet of Things, more specifically the  
verification of modules of Contiki, an open source  
operating system for the IoT.},
