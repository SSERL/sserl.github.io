 abstract = {Frama-C is an extensible modular framework for 
analysis of C programs that offers different 
analyzers in the form of collaborating plugins. 
Currently, Frama-C does not support the proof of 
functional properties of concurrent code.  We 
present conc2seq, a new code transformation based 
tool realized as a Frama-C plugin and dedicated 
to the verification of concurrent C programs. 
Assuming the program under verification respects an 
interleaving semantics, conc2seq transforms the 
original concurrent C program into a sequential one 
in which concurrency is simulated by interleavings. 
User specifications are automatically reintegrated 
into the new code without manual intervention.  The 
goal of the proposed code transformation technique 
is to allow the user to reason about a concurrent 
program through the interleaving semantics using 
existing Frama-C analyzers.},
