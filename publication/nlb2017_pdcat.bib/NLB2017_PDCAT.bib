 abstract = {Parallel programs based on the Divide&Conquer 
paradigm could be successfully defined in a simple 
way using powerlists.  These parallel recursive data 
structures and their algebraic theories offer both a 
methodology to design parallel algorithms and 
parallel programming abstractions to ease the 
development of parallel applications.  The paper 
presents how programs based on powerlists can be 
implemented in Java using the \framework framework 
we developed.  The design of this framework is based 
on powerlists theory, but in the same time follows 
the object-oriented design principles that provide 
flexibility and maintainability.  Examples are given 
and performance experiments are conducted. The 
results emphasise the utility and the efficiency of 
the framework.},
