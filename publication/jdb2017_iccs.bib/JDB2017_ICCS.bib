 abstract = {The BSP model (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) simplifies 
the construction and evaluation of parallel 
algorithms, with its simplified synchronization 
structure and cost model. Nevertheless, imperative 
BSP programs can suffer from synchronization errors. 
Programs with textually aligned barriers are free 
from such errors, and this structure eases program 
comprehension.  We propose a simplified 
formalization of barrier inference as data flow 
analysis, which verifies statically whether an 
imperative BSP program has replicated 
synchronization, which is a sufficient condition for 
textual barrier alignment.},
