While languages and libraries for high performance computing, such as MPI, favor efficiency over productivity, of lot of application domains require that mainstream programmers develop parallel applications without a huge knowledge about parallel programming. An algorithmic skeleton is a pattern of a classical parallel algorithm, and most often, an algorithmic skeleton also corresponds to a sequential algorithm. For example the map algorithmic skeleton applies a function to all the elements of a distributed collection and is related to the application of a function to a sequential collection. For the programmer, a parallel application is then obtained as the combination of several algorithmic skeletons. Orléans Skeleton Library (OSL) is a library of parallel algorithmic skeletons, written in C++ on top of MPI, which uses meta-programming techniques for optimization. Research on high-level parallel programming approaches systematically evaluate the performance of applications written using these approaches and informally argue that high-level parallel programming languages or libraries increase the productivity of programmers. In this talk, I will present OSL and a first attempt to evaluate the trade-off between programming effort and performance of applications developed using different programming models including OSL.","tags":[],"title":"Parallel Programming with the Orleans Skeleton Library","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ana Paula Chaves","Marco Aurélio Gerosa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"073c351f07ebcc76e52d1797fcfbffbc","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/dblp-journalscorrabs-1904-02743/","publishdate":"2019-07-15T21:59:35.142105Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-journalscorrabs-1904-02743/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"How should my chatbot interact?

There are now billions of interconnected devices, and this number is growing. It is anticipated that by 2021, about 46 billions of devices will be in use. Some of these devices are in service in safety and security critical domains, and even in domains that are not necessarily critical, privacy issues may arise with devices collecting and transmitting a lot of personal information. Formal methods have been used successfully for years in highly critical domains, now they can help to bring security into the IoT field. In practice it is common to rely on a combination of formal methods to achieve an appropriate degree of guarantee: static analyses to guarantee the absence of runtime errors, deductive verification of functional correctness, dynamic verification for parts that cannot be proved using deductive verification. This tutorial is focused on Frama-C, which is a source code analysis platform that aims at conducting verification of industrial-size programs written in ISO C99 source code. Frama-C fully supports the combination of formal methods approach, by providing to its users with a collection of plug-ins that perform static and dynamic analysis for safety and security critical software. Moreover collaborative verification across cooperating plugins is enabled by their integration on top of a shared kernel, and their compliance to a common specification language ACSL. Recently Frama-C has been applied to the verification of software in the context of the Internet of Things.","tags":[],"title":"Tutorial   Towards Reliable Things: Formal Verification of IoT Software With Frama C","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Allan Blanchard (Inria Lille Nord Europe, France)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542757290,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542757290,"objectID":"517c831cd7da6e05185f4ca2fe2c58e4","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/talk/applying-formal-methods-to-the-contiki-operating-system/","publishdate":"2018-11-20T16:41:30-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/applying-formal-methods-to-the-contiki-operating-system/","section":"talk","summary":"Contiki is an open-source OS for the IoT. It provides basic OS features on an event-based kernel, including the scheduler, and a networking stack. Contiki focuses on low-power IPv6 connectivity and typically targets devices with an 8 to 32-bit MCU without Memory Management Unit. This makes such devices a target of choice for attackers. In the scope of the VESSEDIA project, that aims at making formal methods more accessible for IoT targets, a task is dedicated to the verification of the Contiki OS. In this talk, I will present the past and present efforts of verification with Frama-C/WP for different modules of Contiki, namely the memory allocation module, the AES-CCM cryptographics functions, and the linked list module.

However, writing comprehensive unit tests is challenging and time-consuming, and developers seldom explore the obscure (and bug-hiding) corners of software behavior without assistance. DeepState is a tool that provides a Google Test-like API to give C and C++ developers push-button access to symbolic execution engines, such as Manticore and angr, and fuzzers, such as Dr. Fuzz. Rather than learning multiple complex tools, users learn one interface for defining a test harness, and can use various methods to automatically generate tests for software. In addition to providing a familiar interface to binary analysis and fuzzing for parameterized unit testing, DeepState also provides constructs that aid in the construction of API-sequence tests, where the tool chooses the functions or methods to call, allowing for even more diverse and powerful tests. By serving as a front-end to multiple tools, DeepState additionally provides a way to apply (novel) high-level strategies to test generation, and to compare effectiveness and efficiency of testing back-ends, including binary analysis tools.","tags":[],"title":"DeepState: Symbolic Unit Testing for C and C++","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Nikolai Kosmatov (CEA List, France) "],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542756877,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542756877,"objectID":"3222c7ffb0f278711c3c6be7f512e63b","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/talk/advanced-test-coverage-criteria-specify-and-measure-cover-and-unmask/","publishdate":"2018-11-20T16:34:37-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/advanced-test-coverage-criteria-specify-and-measure-cover-and-unmask/","section":"talk","summary":"Automatic test data generation (ATG) is a major topic in software engineering. A large amount of research effort has been invested to automate white-box testing. While a wide range of different and sometimes heterogeneous code-coverage criteria have been proposed, testing techniques still lack a generic formalism to describe them all, and available test automation tools usually support only a small subset of them. This talk brings the audience to a journey into the world of white-box testing criteria and their automated support. We try to bridge the gap between the coverage criteria supported by state-of-the-art white-box ATG technologies, such as Dynamic Symbolic Execution, and advanced coverage criteria found in the literature. The talk is articulated around labels, a recent specification mechanism for test objectives, and their effective support in automated testing tools. Labels are generic enough to *specify* many common testing criteria, and amenable to efficient automation making it possible to *cover* the corresponding test objectives and to *measure* the coverage level of a given test suite. We propose several optimization techniques resulting in an effective support for labels in ATG tools. We also show how a combination of static analysis techniques can be efficiently applied to detect — *unmask* — infeasible test objectives that are responsible for waste of test generation effort and imprecise coverage measurement. We demonstrate the LTest toolset for test automation with efficient support of labels. Finally, we present a recent extension of labels, called HTOL (Hyperlabel Test Objectives Language), capable to encode even most advanced test coverage criteria (such as variants of MCDC, dataflow criteria, non-interference properties, etc.), including hyperproperties. This talk is based on a series of recent research and tool implementation efforts [ICST 2014, TAP 2014, ICST 2015, ICST 2017t, ICST 2017r, ICSE 2018].

This paper proposes a metric for measuring distance between executions and specializes it to an important application: determining similarity of failing test cases for the purpose of automated fault identification and localization in debugging based on automatically generated compiler tests. The metric is based on a causal concept of distance where executions are similar to the degree that changes in the program itself introduced by mutation cause similar changes in the correctness of the executions. Specifically if two failing test cases (for the original compiler) become successful due to the same mutant they are more likely to be due to the same fault. We evaluate our metric using more than 50 faults and 2800 test cases for two widely-used real-world compilers and demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods for fault identification and localization.","tags":[],"title":"Causal Distance Metric Based Assistance for Debugging After Compiler Fuzzing","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Salwa Souaf","Pascal Berthomé","Frédéric
