In this   paper, we propose a brokerage solution that   formalizes security properties under the form of   inter-VM relations, and gives the possibility of   setting these security requirements to its customers   from the first steps.

In this paper we target Contiki, a   widely used open-source OS for IoT, and present a   verification case study of one of its most critical   modules: that of linked lists.  Its API and list   representation differ from the classical linked list   implementations, and are particularly challenging   for deductive verification.  The proposed   verification technique relies on a parallel view of   a list through a companion ghost array.  This   approach makes it possible to perform most proofs   automatically using the Frama-C/WP tool, only a   small number of auxiliary lemmas being proved   interactively in the Coq proof assistant.  We   present an elegant segment-based reasoning over the   companion array developed for the proof.  Finally,   we validate the proposed specification by proving a   few functions manipulating lists.","tags":null,"title":"Ghosts for Lists: A Critical Module of Contiki   Verified in Frama-C","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Frédéric Loulergue","Allan Blanchard","Nikolai Kosmatov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514790000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514790000,"objectID":"4d791ad222a5e70b0fac5f62fa127c94","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/lbk2018_tap.bib/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lbk2018_tap.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"Internet of Things (IoT) applications are becoming   increasingly critical and require formal   verification.  Our recent work presented formal   verification of the linked list module of Contiki,   an OS for IoT. It relies on a parallel view of a   linked list via a companion ghost array and uses an   inductive predicate to link both views.  A few   interactively proved lemmas allow for an automatic   proof of other specifications, expressed in the ACSL   specification language and proved with the   Frama-C/WP tool.  In a broader verification context,   especially as long as the whole system is not yet   formally verified, it would be very useful to use   runtime verification, in particular, to test client   modules that use the list module.  It is not   possible with the current specifications, which   include an inductive predicate and axiomatically   defined functions.  In this early-idea paper we show   how to define a provably equivalent non-inductive   predicate and a provably equivalent non-axiomatic   function that belong to the executable subset eacsl   of ACSL and can be transformed into executable C   code.  Finally, we propose an extension of Frama-C   to handle both axiomatic specifications for   deductive verification and executable specifications   for runtime verification.","tags":null,"title":"Ghosts for Lists: from Axiomatic to Executable   Specifications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maurício Finavaro Aniche","Christoph Treude","Igor Steinmacher","Igor Wiese","Gustavo Pinto","Margaret-Anne D.

There are now billions of interconnected   devices, and this number is growing. It is   anticipated that by 2021, about 46 billions of   devices will be in use.  Some of these devices are   in service in security critical domains, and even in   domains that are not necessarily critical, privacy   issues may arise with devices collecting and   transmitting a lot of personal information. Moreover   insufficiently secured devices may be used for   example for massive distributed denial of service   attacks.  This raises important security   challenges. Formal methods have been used   successfully for years in highly critical domains,   now they can help to bring security into the IoT   field.  While the correctness of an implementation   with respect to a formal functional specification   provides the strongest form of guarantee, it can be   very costly to achieve. In practice it is therefore   more common to rely on a combination of formal   methods to achieve an appropriate degree of   guarantee: static analyses to guarantee the absence   of runtime errors, deductive verification of   functional correctness, dynamic verification for   parts that cannot be proved using deductive   verification.  Frama-C is a source code analysis   platform that aims at conducting verification of   industrial-size programs written in ISO C99 source   code. Frama-C fully supports the combination of   formal methods approach, by providing to its users   with a collection of plug-ins that perform static   and dynamic analysis for safety and security   critical software. Moreover collaborative   verification across cooperating plug-ins is enabled   by their integration on top of a shared kernel, and   their compliance to a common specification language:   ACSL~.  Recently Frama-C has been applied to the   verification of software in the context of the   Internet of Things, more specifically the   verification of modules of Contiki, an open source   operating system for the IoT.","tags":null,"title":"Secure Your Things: Secure Development of IoT   Software with Frama-C","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ana Paula Chaves","Marco Aurélio Gerosa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514790000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514790000,"objectID":"c84085b43754f061a6ec2ed3a59c0da7","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/dblp_conf_chi_chavesg18.bib/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp_conf_chi_chavesg18.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Single or Multiple Conversational Agents?: An Interactional Coherence Comparison","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dara Ly","Nikolai Kosmatov","Frédéric Loulergue","Julien Signoles"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514790000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514790000,"objectID":"36409333e85a366cb150435f8bd1e4e0","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/lkl2018_hilt.bib/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lkl2018_hilt.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"An important concern addressed by runtime   verification tools for C code is related to   detecting memory errors.

BSP has been used in  many application domains. BSPlib and its variants  are programming libraries for the C language that  support the BSP style.  Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML  (BSML) is a library for BSP programming with the  functional language OCaml. It offers parallel  operations on a data structure named parallel  vector. BSML provides a global view of programs,  i.e. BSML programs can be seen as sequential  programs working on a parallel data structure (seq  of par) while a BSPlib program is written in the  SPMD style and understood as a parallel composition  of communicating sequential programs (par of  seq). The communication styles of BSML and BSPlib  are also quite different.  The contribution of this  paper is a BSPlib-style communication API  implemented on top of BSML. It has been designed  without extending BSML, but only using the  imperative features of the underlying function  language OCaml. Programs implemented using this API  are very close to programs implemented using a  BSPlib library for the C language. It therefore  shows that BSML is universal for the BSP model.

The lack  of a clean and efficient algorithm for generating  them from regular expressions would have prevented  this theory from being used in practice.  To  alleviate this problem we introduce in this paper an  algorithm that generates a BSP automaton recognizing  a BSP language defined by a BSP regular  expression. The main practical use of BSP automata  developed in this paper is the parallelization of  finite state automata with an explicit distribution  and a performance model, that enable parallel  matching of regular expressions.

BSP has been used in many  application domains. BSPlib and its variants are  programming libraries for the C language that  support the BSP style.  Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML  (BSML) is a library for BSP programming with the  functional language OCaml. It is based on an  extension of the lambda-calculus by parallel  operations on a data structure named parallel  vector. BSML oﬀers a global view of programs,  i.e. BSML programs can be seen as sequential  programs working on a parallel data structure (seq  of par) while a BSPlib program is written in the  SPMD style and understood as a parallel composition  of communicating sequential programs (par of  seq).

In this style of parallelism, an  application is a composition of algorithmic  skeletons. An algorithmic skeleton captures a  pattern of parallel algorithm on a distributed data  structure, and is also often associated with a  sequential algorithm on a sequential data structure  that is the counterpart of the parallel data  structure. The algorithmic skeleton approach has  been inspired by functional programming.  It is  therefore very natural to embed algorithmic  skeletons in a functional programming language. In  this paper we present a new algorithmic skeleton  library for the statically typed functional language  OCaml, and illustrate its use on some  applications. This functional skeletal parallel  programming library is implemented using the Bulk  Synchronous Parallel ML parallel programming library  for OCaml.","tags":null,"title":"Implementing Algorithmic Skeletons with Bulk  Synchronous Parallel ML","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Williamson Alison Freitas Silva","Igor Fabio Steinmacher","Tayana Uchôa Conte"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483254000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483254000,"objectID":"f46b469c3ec01feff1f04ac4419db672","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/dblp_conf_csee_silvasc17.bib/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp_conf_csee_silvasc17.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Is It Better to Learn from Problems or Erroneous Examples?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rahul Gopinath","Iftekhar Ahmed","Mohammad Amin Alipour","Carlos Jensen","Alex Groce"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483254000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483254000,"objectID":"4d96870e05dcaffddd07c21574200ed7","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/gopinathaajg17b.bib/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gopinathaajg17b.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Mutation Reduction Strategies Considered Harmful","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin P.

In order to model BSP program  executions Hains adapted the finite automata theory  to the BSP paradigm by introducing BSP automata  theory.  Benefit provided by BSP automata is  twofold: modeling BSP program control and  parallelizing finite state automata.  The lack of  generation algorithm of BSP automata and the  illusory lack of application of this theory has been  preventing this theory from being used.  We propose  in this paper an algorithm that generates a BSP  automaton recognizing a defined BSP language.  In  order to demonstrate the usefulness of BSP automata  and help to design its use, two applications of the  BSP automata theory are provided. The parallel  recognition of an expression and debugging of a BSP  program.","tags":null,"title":"Automated generation of BSP automata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Amin Alipour","Alex Groce"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451631600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451631600,"objectID":"aebd993233ff6e8aa228f00b577a695f","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/alipourg16.bib/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alipourg16.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Bounded Model Checking and Feature Omission Diversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iftekhar Ahmed","Rahul Gopinath","Caius Brindescu","Alex Groce","Carlos Jensen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451631600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451631600,"objectID":"198c2112084ac61a4234e694dccd1ac3","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/ahmedgbgj16.bib/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ahmedgbgj16.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Can testedness be effectively measured?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Groce","Mohammad Amin Alipour","Chaoqiang Zhang","Yang Chen","John Regehr"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451631600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451631600,"objectID":"572005edceb47ff9c90db9182ca070f9","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/groceazcr16.bib/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/groceazcr16.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Cause reduction: delta debugging, even without bugs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gert-Jan de Vreede","Pedro Antunes","Julita Vassileva","Marco Aurélio Gerosa","Kewen Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451631600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451631600,"objectID":"3682660b24ccdd04fc41f27f87ebb361","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/dblp_journals_isf_vreedeavgw16.bib/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp_journals_isf_vreedeavgw16.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Collaboration technology in teams and organizations: Introduction to the special issue","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Amin Alipour","Alex Groce"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451631600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451631600,"objectID":"6dcf9e10fa9a05d9abc1b448bf25cdc6","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/alipourg16a.bib/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alipourg16a.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Data Poisoning: Lightweight Soft Fault Injection for Python","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mauricio Finavaro Aniche","Marco Aurélio Gerosa","Christoph Treude"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451631600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451631600,"objectID":"66f0354cae1ebcaa5cb170d87cd797ac","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/dblp_conf_sbes_anichegt16.bib/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp_conf_sbes_anichegt16.bib/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Developers' Perceptions on Object-Oriented Design and Architectural Roles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Frédéric Loulergue"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451631600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451631600,"objectID":"14fba5161123c08ca7359431d7a7bb87","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/publication/lou2016_sac.bib/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lou2016_sac.bib/","section":"publication","summary":" The SyDPaCC system is a set of libraries for the pr  oof assistant Coq that allows to write naive (i.e.  inef fi cient) functional programs then to transform  them into ef fi cient versions that could be  automatically parallelized within the framework  before being extracted from Coq to code in the  functional language OCaml plus calls to the parallel  functional programming library Bulk Synchronous  Parallel ML.

Currently, Frama-C does not support the proof of  functional properties of concurrent code.  We  present conc2seq, a new code transformation based  tool realized as a Frama-C plugin and dedicated  to the verification of concurrent C programs.  Assuming the program under verification respects an  interleaving semantics, conc2seq transforms the  original concurrent C program into a sequential one  in which concurrency is simulated by interleavings.  User specifications are automatically reintegrated  into the new code without manual intervention.  The  goal of the proposed code transformation technique  is to allow the user to reason about a concurrent  program through the interleaving semantics using  existing Frama-C analyzers.","tags":null,"title":"conc2seq: A Frama-C Plugin for Verification of  Parallel Compositions of C Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b8acbd440c77a4809a6f0fdb00ef5e56","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/software/bsml/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/bsml/","section":"software","summary":"Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML: A library for functional parallel programming with OCaml","tags":null,"title":"BSML","type":"software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c060c1215fe9aeb54f14d02f400852ea","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/software/deepstate/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/deepstate/","section":"software","summary":"A unit test-like interface for fuzzing and symbolic execution","tags":null,"title":"DeepState","type":"software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ff09c1f0995da9031dc9b69fe5b172c9","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/software/sydpacc/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/sydpacc/","section":"software","summary":"A set of libraries for the Coq proof assistant for the systematic development of correct parallel programs","tags":null,"title":"SyDPaCC","type":"software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"450306ea806069914ad4be4acf6d6935","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/software/tstl/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/tstl/","section":"software","summary":"The Template Scripting Testing Language","tags":null,"title":"TSTL","type":"software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1e6681ee882be1354b820a95b6b6fff","permalink":"https://sserl.github.io/software/universalmutator/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/universalmutator/","section":"software","summary":"Regexp based tool for mutating generic source code across numerous languages","tags":null,"title":"universal mutator","type":"software"}]
